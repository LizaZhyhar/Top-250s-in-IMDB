Top-250s-in-IMDB is a data set containing detailed information about the 250 most popular movies in the IMDB rating. Fistly, I cleaned up the data (filling in empty values, editing and adding columns). After that, I started analyzing and visualizing the data, in order to find out, for example, the most popular and unpopular genres, the top 10 films by rating, correlation between different parameters and so on.
